# TRIMUI-inspiration
Files that I use with my Trimui Smart Pro.

I bought a **Trimui Smart Pro** portable game device to enjoy retro games. What I liked on this is that has a fairly good ARM processor, and is based on Linux. Because of that, you can customize it in many ways.
Here I will share the files that I'm using with device.

Enjoy!
